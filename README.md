# ARObjectYoloRect

![Sample](https://github.com/newrachael/ARObjectYoloRect/blob/main/Image/YoloCup.jpeg?raw=true)

## Introduction

This open-source project leverages the power of SceneKit(AR) and YOLO (You Only Look Once) to create an iOS application that detects objects and draws bounding boxes around them in real-time using Augmented Reality. SceneKit(AR) allows users to interact with 3D objects in a real-world environment through their iOS devices, and YOLO offers accurate and fast object detection.

Includes code to map the coordinate system recognized by Yolo to ARSCNView.
